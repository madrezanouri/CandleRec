# CandleRec
I’m about to build (if it needs to) and train a Neural Network for recognizing the market’s price candle patterns. (It’s about 60 classes of different key patterns) | The goal of the project is to create and deploy an innovative tool to signal us when a key candle pattern is occurring considering on-going price data.
